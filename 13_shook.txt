All night long we waited
for our imminent demise
for capitalism to dismantle itself
and the crown to fall
and us all to realize that 
There never really was a crown at all

Oh blood moon, the things you've seen


This skin is just a shroud



Shivering in the LED light
Electric jellyfish writhing on the shore
WHile the crescent moon shine



The flood will wash down mission street

Let the stars fall on Alabama Street

Crumbling into the water where
the bay becomes an assemblage


And we continue BECOMING

The beauty of the assemblage is that, since it lacks organization, it can draw into its body any number of disparate elements. The book itself can be an assemblage, but its status as an assemblage does not prevent it from containing assemblages within itself or entering into new assemblages with readers, libraries, bonfires, bookstores, etc.
